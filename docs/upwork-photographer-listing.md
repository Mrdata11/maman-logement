## Title
Research & Build a List of 1,000+ Photographers for Spiritual Retreats & Wellness Events (France & Europe)

## Description

We are building a directory platform for the spiritual and wellness industry in France and Europe. We need a detail-oriented virtual assistant to research and compile a list of **1,000+ photographers** who specialize in (or are well-suited for) spiritual retreats, yoga events, wellness seminars, and similar gatherings.

### What you'll do

- Search Google, Instagram, freelance platforms (Malt, Fiverr), wedding/event directories, and any other relevant source to find photographers
- For each photographer, fill in a Google Sheet with the following information:
  - Full name
  - Business name (if applicable)
  - Website URL
  - Instagram handle
  - Email address
  - Phone number (if publicly available)
  - City & Country
  - Specialties (e.g. yoga, retreats, wellness, ceremonies, nature, portraits)
  - Portfolio link
  - Relevance score (1-5): how well their style fits spiritual/wellness events
  - Source (where you found them)
  - Notes
- Avoid duplicates — check before adding
- Focus on quality: we want photographers whose visual style matches the spiritual/wellness world (natural light, nature settings, intimate moments, mindful aesthetics)

### Search strategy (suggestions, not exhaustive)

- Google searches: "photographe retraite spirituelle", "wellness retreat photographer Europe", "photographe yoga France", "photographe événement bien-être", etc.

- Yoga/wellness magazines and blogs — check photo credits

### Geographic scope

- **Priority:** France (all regions)
- **Secondary:** Spain, Portugal, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, UK, Scandinavia
- We want broad European coverage but France should represent ~50% of the list

### Deliverable

- A clean, deduplicated Google Sheet with 1,000+ entries
- Delivered in batches (e.g. 250 every few days so we can review quality early)
- First batch of 50 within the first 2 days for quality review

### Ideal candidate

- Detail-oriented and organized
- Comfortable with web research and navigating different platforms
- Familiar with the wellness/spiritual space (or willing to learn what "fits")
